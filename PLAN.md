# tic-tac-toe-project
This game will allow user to play tic-tac-toe against a computer

Design plan -

No. 1
// Prompt user to choose X or O
// Given user clicks X, make a score card appear that is holding a couple of divs, 
// divs should X and O at zero
// Start fxn that randomly puts mark in any given box

No. 2
// Once that occurs, check if player has one (ie, if box 1&2&2 = x then do this -- will write design for this later)
// Note: May do this each time, even though nobody can win after only one turn, just to keep it simple and flowing
// Note: Try to use .this for above code

No. 3 
// Write win function to detect if player won
// Part I: Each time X or O is sent to html,
// run checker to see if anyone has won
// Part II: If a there is a winner, send message to say they won, 
// then restart code
// Include button on page that always allows player to reset to the
// point where they choose X/O

No. 4
// Maybe add delay for realism
// ie, after player has made a selection, wait 1-2 seconds before machine pushes,
// then allow user to make their move

No. 5
// Research how to win or tie at tic-tac-toe
// Research this assuming machine goes first
// Write algorithm to handle responses




TODO -

// Still need to correctly incorporate loop
// Function to check if someone has won doesn't appear to work everytime
// Seems like code is running to rand function and not using the set conditionals
